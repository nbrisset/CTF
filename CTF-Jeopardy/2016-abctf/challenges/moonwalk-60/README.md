>There is something a little off about [this picture](PurpleThing.png).

>If you could help us we could give you some points! Just find us a flag!

We are given a link to an image.

Just in order to be sure, let's use the "file" command. It might be totally something else than expected.

```console
root@blinils:~/ABCTF# file PurpleThing.png
PurpleThing.png: PNG image data, 3200 x 2953, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

Then, I am used to launching [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) in order to check the metadata of the picture.

Sometimes, the flag is hidden in metadata fields, such as "Author", "Profile Copyright", "Camera Model"...

```console
root@blinils:~/ABCTF# exiftool PurpleThing.png

This file is quite heavy, it might have hidden data in it,
as for the [Banana Boy challenge](/CTF-Jeopardy/2016-sctf-q1/challenges/banana-boy-20)
from the [sCTF event](/CTF-Jeopardy/2016-sctf-q1).

Let's use [binwalk](http://tools.kali.org/forensics/binwalk) and
[hachoir-subfile](https://hachoir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subfile.html),
which are tools designed to analyze and extract data contained in a file.

```console
root@blinils:~/ABCTF# hachoir-subfile PurpleThing.png
[+] Start search on 2354256 bytes (2.2 MB)

[+] File at 0: PNG picture: 3200x2953x32 (alpha layer)
[+] File at 765455 size=1588789 (1.5 MB): JPEG picture
 
[+] End of search -- offset=2354256 (2.2 MB)

```

Yeah, there is a JPEG picture inside our PNG purple thing, which we have to extract with binwalk.

```console
root@blinils:~/ABCTF# binwalk -e PurpleThing.png

```

Unluckily, the expected JPEG file is not in the extracted data.
But we have a large toolbox, let's use [foremost](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/foremost) instead!

```console
root@blinils:~/ABCTF# foremost -v Purple.png

```

We eventually find the extracted file in the "output" folder: [/root/ABCTF/output/jpg/00001495.jpg](00001495.jpg).

Solution: ABCTF{PNG_S0_C00l}

Or kind of, there was a little controversy about the letter case... png or PNG? cOOl C00l cOO1...?
