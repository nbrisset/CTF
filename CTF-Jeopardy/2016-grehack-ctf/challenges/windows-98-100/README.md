# Windows 98 (Forensic, 100 points)

> Windows 98 could hide many things :)

> sha1sum : 6f924b4fb2500ffaf41b7fcc5f4ed86718987de5

This was the first out of three forensic challenges:
we had to find a flag in a [tarball file](files/1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz).

First of all, we checked the file's type and its SHA-1 digest, then we extracted the files and checked their types too.

```console
root@blinils:~/GH16# sha1sum 1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz
6f924b4fb2500ffaf41b7fcc5f4ed86718987de5  1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz

root@blinils:~/GH16# file 1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz
1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Mon Nov 14 12:36:06 2016, from Unix

root@blinils:~/GH16# tar -zxf 1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz && ls
1479483212.99_win98.tar.gz  win98.jpg  win98.mp4

root@blinils:~/GH16# file w*

+ [win98.jpg](images/win98.jpg) shows a [fatal exception error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_exception_error)
of MS Windows, which involves a [blue screen of death](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cran_bleu_de_la_mort).
+ [win98.mp4](images/win98.mp4) shows a press demonstration with Bill Gates, following the release of Windows 98.

Quoting the article [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_98&oldid=756670860) from Wikipedia:

```
The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April, 1998.
Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for
Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in,
the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Gates remarked after derisive applause
and cheering from the audience, "That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet." Video footage of
this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.
```

Is there any hidden data? Let's use "binwalk", a tool designed to analyze and extract data contained in a file.

```console
root@blinils:~/GH16# binwalk win98.jpg

Yeah, we found something: 
a [JPEG image](images/jpgwin98.jpg) and a [PDF document](files/pdfwin98.pdf) are in the original JPG!

Let's extract these new files from the offsets 55519 and 83895, with the "dd" command.

```console
root@blinils:~/GH16# dd skip=55519 if=./win98.jpg of=./pdfwin98.pdf bs=1

![WOW A KEY IN THE PDF!](images/screen-pdfwin98.png)

It should be noted that win98.jpg is a [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29) file!
You should test it yourself, with `feh win98.jpg` and `xpdf win98.jpg`
[Ange Albertini](https://github.com/corkami) spoke about
[binary polyglots and weird binary file formats](https://www.sstic.org/2013/presentation/polyglottes_binaires_et_implications/)
during the 2013 edition of SSTIC, please have a look at his presentation!

The jpgwin98.jpg file only showed the logo of [TrueCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt), a software which
can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file.

But what is the relationship between TrueCrypt and this challenge?

... wait a second.

What if win98.mp4 is also a polyglot file, being at once a video file and an encrypted disk?

Once TrueCrypt is downloaded and ready for use, we tried to open win98.mp4 as a disk, with the key found earlier.

Gotcha! We got a flag.txt file in it: GH16{Polyglotte_and_Windows98_Is_Fun}
